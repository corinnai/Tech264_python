# Jira 
- JIRA is a project management and issue-tracking tool


# Key Agile Terms you’ll Find in JIRA
- Stories and Epics
  -  **User Story** : As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`.
  - **Epics**: An epic is a story that is too big for a single sprint. It’s broken down into multiple user stories. When those are done, the epic is complete.

# Jira Terms 
-  Issues and Projects
   -  Issues are containers for fields, and fields 
hold all of your data.
        - Example of fields:
          - description
          - summary
          - due date
          - attachments
   - Projects : Issues live inside your jira projects
  

# Team-Managed Projects vs Company-Managed Projects

## Company-Managed Projects
- Global entities
- Must be Jira admin to create
- More complicated to set up and maintain
## Team-Managed Projects 
- Project scope entities
- No special permissions to create
- Fast and easy to set up and maintain

## Team-managed projects
### Step 1: Log in to Jira
- Go to your Jira instance and log in with your credentials.
### Step 2: Go to the Projects Page
- In the left sidebar, select **Projects**.
- Click on **Create project** at the top.
### Step 3: Choose Project Type
- In the "Create project" window, you’ll see options for **Team-managed** and **Company-managed projects**.
- Select Team-managed project.
### Step 4: Select a Project Template
- Choose the template that best suits your project’s needs, such as **Kanban**, **Scrum**, or **Bug Tracking**.
- Each template has different settings tailored for different types of work.
### Step 5: Configure Project Details
- Enter the **Project name**.
- Jira will automatically generate a **Project key**, which you can customize if desired (3–4 character identifier).
- Choose a **project lead** if needed. The default will be your account if you are the creator.
### Step 6: Create the Project
- Click on **Create** or **Create project** to finalize the creation.
- Jira will set up the project based on the template you chose, creating sample tasks and workflows if necessary.
### Step 7: Customize Your Project (Optional)
- Once created, you can customize project settings, including **columns** (in Kanban) or **sprints** (in Scrum).
- Set permissions for your team members if required.
### Step 8: Invite Team Members
- Under the **People** section, add team members by entering their emails or usernames.
- Assign them roles if needed (e.g., admin, member).
### Step 9: Start Using Your Project
- Begin creating **issues, tasks**, or **epics** as needed.
- Track progress, set priorities, and use the board to manage tasks.
