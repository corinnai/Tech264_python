#4. Concatenate these variables with different data types

# What is concatenation? Give a simple example with your code.
    # Concatenation --- process of joining 2 or more strings together using +
                  # --- only can concatenate springs
x = 2
y = 2
z = x + y
print(z)

#
x = 2
y = 5.4
z = " there's now a number 25.4 unless we put a space in!"
print(str(x) + str(y) + z)   # str transform number into string
